            Uh begin the record, Name: agent Ledros. Leader of the field investigation team for the P.D.A, I hate Tuesdays we are currently being escorted to the grimmest the saddest natural place on earth, Death forest Japan. This forest known the number of suicides that happened in there, any tormented soul end everything here. The amount of pain and rage coming out of this forest is tremendous, I was suicidal once nothing kept me in check but her my wife Rose, what am I saying it’s an investigation record.
            Three weeks ago, we had reports of a giant bird flying at night, but every day this…... bird was found in different country every night. Causing discord and panic every where he goes leaving a weird mark, it’s like he was calling for help and, as went further and further into the forest… I stopped and stared at a gruesome scene a young adult age 24, 23. Black hair, hung from a tree two wings sprouted from the back, the left one is white as snow and the right side is black as the night, his body is scratched his arm right arm is broken, it’s like he was fighting with someone or something. A notebook stapled to his chest after my team slowly getting him down from there, I went closely to inspect the body still can’t believe it’s a suicide. My partner taking the notebook from his chest, as I opened his eyes the left one was all black and the right one was white his arms were different like a beast, he had claws on the right and something like a blade on the left, everything was broken his arms fingers and legs, my partner said {Ledros…... I think this was meant for you} handing me the notebook at first, I did not know what he was talking about out of curiosity wore a glove and opened the notebook and it reads: { agent b please if you are reading this please hand the notebook to agent Ledros and please tell them they can’t cut my winds no matter what} I stopped reading to look behind me and the body they were about to try cutting his wings the blades snaped, the wings were so dense like they were made of metal I got close to observe more his wings got stiffer like there are crystalizing, and… I just couldn’t get over what just happened, it’s like he is here writhing this right now to me, I continued reading more {thank you sir, firstly my name is Charly I was diagnosed with split personality disorder, I have been suffering from depression, people hated me for who I am never gave me a chance I have been called trash of humanity and other things, even when I did love someone she did not care about me did not have anything to call my own, running from people afraid of pain and humiliation, so we took it on our self to despise humanity itself. Taking every thing from me and leaving me with nothing, till I started hating myself each day, more and more hatred, built up till the point 
            of no return. But first I have to take revenge on those who took my life away from me those people deserve to die suffering screaming in agony and despair so they can feal what I felt all these years pushed around and hated for no reason they will see their families cry thinking their death was for no reason, show them the darkness they seeded inside my heart. I started killing and killing till I had one last victim but when I saw her face full of fear, I saw the monster have become I started fighting the voices inside my head running away to remote areas so he couldn’t hurt any one moving, till the metamorphosis got worse and worse, he started taking full control, I couldn’t live with the burden of killing people any some so I decided to take my own and stop others pain and mine, small price to all the pain I caused. And I donate my body and soul to your cause to prevent any other supernatural to damage any other life}, his words were too dark but heart melting, knowing the fact that people could be so cruel to others for no apparent reason even pushing him to a such dark place, and even his end was in struggle and pain.
            As we went back to the H.Q we examined his brain still working, we started adding on his vitals and expanding his brain activity beyond communicating, we made his to be a super computer capable of communicating and calculating faster than any other, also he can predict the future and locate any abnormal activity within seconds, his name {the oracle} we refer to him in other reports as {code 1}.
            And this is the end of his story as a human, and the beginning of his life as an agent of the P.D.A.
            End of report.

                February 4th 2018
                Section 7 U.F.O department dispatched by code 1 to retrieve a meteor fell on the west boarders of Mexico. Ordered to evacuate the scene and retrieve it as soon as possible.
                As the team was evacuating the scene murmurs of the {Diablo Cristales} that what they called the meteor, it was a hexagonal shaped crystal glowing with bright red energy, the readers couldn’t detect it at all, with a careful step they leaded the meteor in the container and moved to the H.Q, on the way the team experienced some violence from the locals screaming at them. After the crystal was transported to the H.Q in a room close to code 1, for further investigations.
                As the cargo was being transported to H.Q, there was a crimson red light emitting from the stone itself, the soldiers safe guarding the stone were all looking directly at it, a sudden panic hit the container, all of the soldiers were screaming and running around like they being chased by some thing or someone.
                The container stopped on the side of the road, the other following cars stopped to check the cargo, the soldiers all surrounded the cargo, as it moved around like there is monster inside of it dents engraved on it, all of the soldiers took some steps back. The smell of fear and blood caried by the air, the leader of the squad took some steps forward opening the lock of the container to check what is happening, to see all the soldiers are gone only scratch marks and dents on the container.
